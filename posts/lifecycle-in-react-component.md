Everything in React is made up of components or parts of components and every components follow a certain lifecycle, almost like the lifecycle of any living thing on earth üåé. They are born, grow, and eventually die.

The phase when they are born is called **mount**. When they are grow is called **update**. The last phase of death is called **unmount**.

This whole process is called the **Component Lifecycle**. For each of these phases, React renders certain built-in methods called lifecycle methods that control the behavior of components.

We can see on the diagram below all of React lifecycle methods associated with the mounting, updating, umounting of the component. *(diagram credit: [dan abramov](https://twitter.com/dan_abramov/status/981712092611989509?lang=en))*

I will explain in following section about each methods that available for each lifecycle in more detail.

# Mounting Lifecycle Methods

The mounting phase, is a phase where is the component is created and inserted into the DOM.
## 1. `constructor()`

`constructor()` is the very first method called as the component is created. This method is used for two purposes:

- To initialize the local state of a component

- To bind an event handling method to an instance

Here is an example of `constructor()` method in action:

```js
constructor(props) {
  super(props);
  this.state = { fruit: 'Apple üçé' }
  this.eatFruit = this.eatFruit.bind(this);
}
```

Note that, `constructor()` is the first method invoked before the component is mounted into the DOM. We should not introduce any side effect in this method.

## 2.`getDerivedFromProps()`

`getDerivedStateFromProps()` is a new React lifecycle method as of [React 17](https://reactjs.org/docs/react-component.html#static-getderivedstatefromprops) and designed to replace `componentWillReceiveProps()`.

The purpose of this function is to make sure that the state and props are in sync for when it is required.

`getDerivedStateFromProps()` lifecycle runs after the constructor method and before the `componentDidMount()` lifecycle run. This function accepts two paramenters `props` and `state`. We have to return an object to update state or null to indicate that nothing has changed.

To get better understanding of how `getDerivedStateFromProps()` works, let see the following code:

```js
import React from 'react';

class FavFruit extends React.Component {
  constructor() {
    super(props);
    this.state = {
      favFruit: 'Banana üçå';
    }
  }

  render() {
    return(
      <h2>My Favorite Fruit is {this.state.favFruit}</h2>
    );
  }
}
```

When the component mount, we will see `My Favorite Fruit is Banana üçå` is showed up in the browser. How can we change our state from `Banana üçå` into `Apple üçé` before `render()`? Actually, we can do it via `getDerivedStateFromProps()`.

```js
import React from 'react';

class FavFruit extends React.Component {
  constructor() {
    super(props);
    this.state = {
      favFruit: 'Banana üçå';
    }
  }

  // Not Recommended. For explaining purpose only.
  static getDerivedStateFromProps(props, state) {
    return {
      favFruit: 'Apple üçé'
    }
  }

  render() {
    return(
      <h2>My Favorite Fruit is {this.state.favFruit}</h2>
    );
  }
}
```

When the component mount, we will see `My Favorite Fruit is Apple üçé` is showed up in the browser rather than `Banana üçå`. How can this works? By returning an object, `getDerivedStateFromProps()` can utilize its data and doing update for `favFruit` before `render()` method is called to render the DOM. Noted that `getDerivedStateFromProps()` is takes 2 argument, the first argument is `props` and the second argument is `state`.

This short example is contrived and not really representative of the way how to use `getDerivedStateFromProps()`. But it‚Äôs helpful for understanding the basics. However, just because we can update state via `getDerivedStateFromProps()` it doesn‚Äôt mean we should. There are specific use cases on when we should use `getDerivedStateFromProps()`. If we use it in the wrong context, we‚Äôll be solving a problem with the wrong tool üî®. 

When should we use the `getDerivedStateFromProps()`? We must know why this method is created in first place. There are some cases where the component is needed update the internal state in response to a prop change. Component state in this manner is referred to as [derived state](https://reactjs.org/blog/2018/06/07/you-probably-dont-need-derived-state.html#when-to-use-derived-state).

## 3.`render()`

`render()` method is called after `getDerivedStateFromProps()` is called.

```js
import React from 'react';

class HelloWorld extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return <h1>Hello World! üåé</h1>
  }
}
```

What we return in `render()` will be rendered into the DOM. In the example above we are returning `JSX`. But we can also return an `array of JSX` `string`, `number`, or if we don‚Äôt want to render anything, we could return a `boolean` or `null`

```js
import React from 'react';

class HelloWorld extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return [
      <div key='1'>"Hello World! üåé"</div>,
      <div key='2'>"Hello World! üåé"</div>]
  }
}
```

Note that in example above we add `key` property in `jsx`. It is used by React to identify and keep track for which items in the list are changed, updated, or deleted.

## 4.`componentDidMount()`

After `render()` is called (The component is mounted into the DOM), `componentDidMount()` will be invoked. This method is the place when you should do a **side effect** thing. Like make a subscription to an API, data fetching, or maybe make a change into the DOM.

```js
import React from 'react';

class ChangeDocTitle extends React.Component() {
  componentDidMount() {
    document.title = 'Hello World üåé';
  }

  render() {
    return<h1>This component will change the title of your current tab</h1>
  }
}

```

# Updating Lifecycle Methods

The update phase, is a phase where the component doing a re-render (updating the state) that has been triggered because of `state` or `prop` change.

## 1.`getDerivedFromProps()`

This method is also invoked when the component doing an update. Since I already give an explanation of `getDerivedFromProps()` on mounting phase, please refer on that ü§ì. Note that `getDerivedFromProps()` is invoked when the component is mounted and when the component is doing re-render.

## 2.`shouldComponentUpdate()`

After `getDerivedProps()` is called, `shouldComponentUpdate()` is invoked. This method accepts two arguments, the first argument is the `nextProps` and the second argument is `nextState`.

The purpose of this function is to determine is wheter the component is will be re-render by returning `true` or not by returing `false`.

```js
import React from 'react';

class FavFood extends Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {
      favMeal: 'French Fries üçü'
    };
  }

  shouldComponentUpdate(nextProps, nextState) {
    // let's assume that the currentProps in this example { favDrink: 'Cola ü•§' }
    if (nextProps.favDrink == 'Cola ü•§') {
      // The component is won't be updated if the currentProps.favDrink is still same with the nextProps.favDrink even when the nextState is different with currentState
      return false;
    } else {
      return true;
    }
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <h1>My Fav Drink is: {this.props.favDrink}</h1>
        <h1>My Fav Meal is: {this.state.favMeal}</h1>
        <button onClick={() => {this.setState({favMeal: 'Burger üçî'})}}>Change My Meal! üçΩ</button>
      </div>
    );
  }
}
```

Notice that in the contrived example above, we can click `Change My Meal! üçΩ` to change the state of `favMeal` however in `shouldComponentUpdate()` we make a conditioning where if the `nextProps` of `favDrink` is still `Cola ü•§` (still the same with `currentProps`) then **the component will be not be updated**. 

`shouldComponentUpdate()` is a powerful method. However as proverb says *"With Great Power Comes Great Responsibility"*, we must treat this method with caution. If we didn't careful with our conditioning and accidentally returning `false`, the component is not updated and this can be a problem and it will be hard to debug it üêû.

## 3.`render()`

`render()` method is called immediately depending on the returned value from `shouldComponentUpdate()`, which defaults to `true`.

## 4. `getSnapshotBeforeUpdate()`

Once `render()` is called, `getSnapshotBeforeUpdate()` is invoked just before the DOM is being rendered. It is used to store the previous values of the state after the DOM is updated. Any value returned by `getSnapshotBeforeUpdate()` will be used as a parameter for `componentDidUpdate()` which will be explained after this. ```getSnapshotBeforeUpdate()` accepts two arguments which is `prevProps` and `prevState`.

```js
import React from 'react';

class FavSuperHero extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = { mySuperHero: 'Thor ‚ö°Ô∏è' }
  }

  componentDidMount() {
    setTimeout(() => {
      this.setState({ mySuperHero: 'IronMan üöÄ' })
    }, 1000)
  }

  getSnapshotBeforeUpdate(prevProps, prevState) {
    document.getElementById('prevHero').innerHTML = `Previous Super Hero: ${prevState.mySuperHero}`
  }

  componentDidUpdate() {
    document.getElementById('newHero').innerHTML = `New Super Hero: ${prevState.mySuperHero}`
  }

  render() {
    return(
      <div>
        <h1 id='prevHero'></h1>
        <h1 id='newHero'></h1>
      </div>
    );
  }
}
```

From the code above we can get the `prevState` and showing `Previous Super Hero: Thor ‚ö°Ô∏è` which is the old state that have been updated into `New Super Hero: IronMan üöÄ` which is the current state.

Note that, it is highly recommended to never directly to set state in `getSnapshotBeforeUpdate()`, otherwise it will trigger `render()` method.

## 5. `componentDidUpdate()`

React supports four mounting lifecycle methods for component classes:

- `constructor()`

- `getDerivedStateFromProps()`

- `render()`

- `componentDidMount()`

After the component

- **Mounting**

- **Updating**

- **Unmounting**
